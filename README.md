# Workouts Tracker

## Introduction

Workouts Tracker is a **Spring Boot** application that helps you store your training data, track your progress, and generate statistics about your workouts. This app solves the problem of workout tracking by providing a structured and efficient way to log exercises and analyze performance trends.

Alternatively, you can use the built-in Spring Boot command:

```

For a full list of API endpoints, refer to the API documentation (Swagger or Postman collection).
